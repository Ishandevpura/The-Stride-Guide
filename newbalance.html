    <h1>New Balance has a wide variety of shoes to offer. Here are its top 5. </h1>
    <h4>(in my opinion)</h4>
            <br>
    <div>
        <h2>Fuelcell Rebel v5</h2>
        <p>The Rebel is a daily trainer that is on the faster side of trainers. It has a midsolde made out of Fuelcell foam and can be used in any scenario from easy runs to your hardest workouts, though it's suited for more faster paces. It is priced at $140, making it one of the more affordable daily trainers. </p>

    <br>
    <div>
        <h2>Fresh Foam X 1080 v14</h2>
        <p>The 1080 is a daily trainer that is very comfortable. It features a fresh foam X foam and a wide toe box for more breathability and comfortability. Its best use case is for those very easy runs, or long runs if you are on tired legs. It is priced at $165.</p>
        <hr>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        <h2>Fuelcell Supercomp Trainer</h2>
        <p>The SC trainer is New Balance's 'supertrainer'. This is because it features a carbon fiber plate with the Fuelcell foam in its midsole. This shoe is built to go faster with its energy arc system. It is used for those long hard runs and workouts with the energy return you can get from it. It is priced at $190.</p>
        <hr>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        <h2>Fuelcell Supercomp Elite</h2>
        <p>The Elite is NB's top end shoe, for those races and key workouts that you have. With a midsole made out of an Energy Arc aarbon plate and Fuelcell superfoam, it offers some of the most energy return of any shoe. It is priced at $250.</p>
        <hr>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        <h2>Fresh Foam X More v5</h2>
        <p>The More v5 is New Balance's max cushion recovery shoe. It has a lot of cushioning with its foam of Fresh Foam, and it has a very high stack height (40 mm at the heel and 36 mm at the toe) to make you feel like you are running on clouds. It does not offer much speed though, and it is best used for those long and easy runs. It is priced at $155.</p>
