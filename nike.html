    <h1>Nike has a wide variety of shoes to offer. Here are its top 5. </h1>
    <h4>(in my opinion)</h4>
            <br>
    <div>
        <h2>Nike Alphafly/Vaporfly</h2>
        <p>The Alphafly and Vaporfly are Nike's top end road racing shoes. Priced at around $290 and $270 respectively, These shoes feature Nike's most high end foam with a full length carbon plate to offer the most energy return. However, these aren't the most durable shoes, so it is best to use them sparingly for only the important workouts and races. The Alphafly is more reccomended for longer distances like the marathon, and the vaporfly is reccomended for shorter distances. like the 5k and 10k.</p>

        <h2>Nike Pegasus</h2>
        <p>The Pegasus is Nike's standard daily trainer. It is priced at around $140 and can be used as a do it all trainer for any type of run. It is more on the firmer side, and offers plenty of value for your money.</p>

    <br>
    <div>
        <h2>Nike Vomero</h2>
        <p>The Vomero is a more premium version of the Nike Pegasus, coming in $160. It offers more cushioning with having a combination of ZoomX and ReactX foams to provide responsiveness along with cushioning. It serves as a daily trainer.</p>
        <hr>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        <h2>Nike Streakfly</h2>
        <p>The Streakfly is Nike's short distance road racing shoes. The Streakfly 2, especially, is built for those key shorter workouts and races such as the road mile, and 5k. Priced at $190, it is a lightweight shoe with a carbon fiber plate in it's midsole. Due to this, it has less durability than a normal trainer, but will propel you forward on the miles you can run with it.</p>
        <hr>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        <h2>Nike Zoomfly</h2>
        <p>The Zoom fly is Nike's workout shoe. It is specialized to be used for those track sessions or tempo runs, with more durablity than the racing shoes. Priced at $180, it also includes a full length carbon plate, but with more durable foam.</p>
