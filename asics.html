    <h1>Asics has a wide variety of shoes to offer. Here are its top 5. </h1>
    <h4>(in my opinion)</h4>
            <br>
    <div>
        <h2> Asics Metaspeed Sky/Edge </h2>
        <p>The Metaspeed Sky/Edge are the flagship racing shoes of Asics. You can use them anywhere from 5k to a marathon on the road. They have a carbon plate in their midsole made out of FF Blast Turbo Plus foam, Asics' most high-end foam to offer the most energy return of all their foam. You should get the Sky if you have a longer stride, and you should use the Edge if you have a higher cadence. The market price is $250.</p>

    <br>
    <div>
        <h2>Asics Novablast</h2>
        <p>The Novablast 5 is Asics' versatile daily trainer. You can use it for almost any run, though it's best suited for moderate to easy runs. Its FF Blast Max foam is softer and responsive, though it does not include a plate. The market price is $150.</p>
        <hr>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        <h2>Asics Superblast</h2>
        <p>The Superblast 2 is a more premium version of the Novablast. It is also one of the most versatile shoes, able to handle both faster and slower paces. However, it is priced at $200.</p>
        <hr>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        <h2>Asics Magic Speed</h2>
        <p>The Magic Speed 4 serves as a bridge between training and racing. It is a medium budget option for shorter races, and can be used for speed workouts, like tempos or intervals. It features a carbon fiber plate and is on the firmer side. It is priced at $170</p>
        <hr>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        <h2>Asics Gel Nimbus</h2>
        <p>The Gel Nimbus 27 is Asics' recovery shoe, for easy runs. It is extremely soft with a high stack height and generous amounts of FF Blast Plus Eco foam, one of the softest out there. It is priced at $165.</p>
