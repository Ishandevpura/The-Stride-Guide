            <h1>How To Choose the Perfect Running Shoe for You!</h1>
            <h3>Running shoes can ultimately make or break your running career. That's why you need to take the time to carefully pick out the right shoe for you.</h3>
            <h3>There are many factors to consider when getting the perfect running shoe for you.
            These include how many miles you run, the type of running you do, the type of surfaces you run on, your foot strike, and most importantly, your budget.
            Let's go through each of these factors.</h3>

                <h2>Your Mileage</h2>
            <br>
                <p>The number of miles that you run plays a key role in determining the kind of shoes that are best for you. Some shoes might be better for you if you run more miles due to their cushioning, while some might be better for you if you run fewer miles because of their low durability but high value.</p>
                <p>For example, a shoe like the New Balance Rebel v4 is a great workout shoe, but many runners have reported the shoe breaking down after around 200 miles. For high-mileage runners, that could be just a month's worth of use, making it less beneficial in the long run and harder on your wallet. However, if you run around 10 miles a week, it will last you a while, and will be good bang for your buck.</p>
                <p>Overall, you want to have a shoe with good durability in general, and even better durability the higher mileage you run.</p>

                <h2> The Type of Running </h2>
            <br>
                <p>There are many different kinds of running, and many different paces to run. The kinds of running are usually split up into three categories: Racing, workouts, and easy running. Different shoes are specifically made for different needs, and shoes often don't perform well outside of the type of running they were designed for.</p>
                <p><strong> Racing: </strong>For racing, typically you should use lighter shoes, and a shoe that has a good energy return. Sometimes these shoes also have a plate in their midsole to boost your energy return rate. These plates are made up of springy materials, like nylon and carbon. Due to this elite technology, racing shoes are often more expensive than your training shoes.</p>
                <p><strong> Workouts: </strong>For workouts, it is generally the same type of shoe: fast and lightweight. However, they are typically not as fast, and a lot of the times don't have that plate that racers have. Instead, they have more foam, to allow for more durability for your training, as you will use them more than your racing.</p>
                <p><strong> Recovery: </strong>For easy running, shoes typically have more foam under your feet to help you recover for those harder sessions. They are not as fast, but they are very durable, as you should do the bulk of your miles at an easy pace.</p>

                <h2>Running Surface</h2>
            <br>
                <p>There are four main surfaces to choose from: road, track, trail, and treadmill.</p>
                <p><strong>Road: </strong>If you mainly run on the road or sidewalk, you typically need less grip, but extra cushion is recommended due to the stress on your legs from the hard surface.</p>
                <p><strong>Trail: </strong>If you mainly run on the trail, you should aim for shoes with very good grip and traction, good protection from weather, and good stability on those uneven, variable surfaces.</p>
                <p><strong>Treadmill: </strong>For running on the treadmill, it's more or less the same as the road, but you don't need shoes as cushioned since a treadmill isn't as hard as the road.</p>
                <p><strong>Track: </strong>Lastly, if you run on a track, then many people suggest getting spikes or flats for extra grip and traction on the track, especially on the turns.</p>

                <h2>Foot Strike</h2>
            <br>
                <p>Your foot strike also plays a key role in determining what shoe is best for you. You can scan your running form at a dedicated running shoe store, and it will tell whether you are a heel striker, midfoot, or forefoot striker. Forefoot-oriented shoes are typically more aggressive, while heel striking-oriented shoes have extra cushion on the heel to absorb the impact. A midfoot shoe is a good balance between the two. </p>

        <div>
                <h2>Your Budget</h2>
            <br>
                <p>Overall, the biggest thing that influences what shoes you buy is ultimately your budget. Even though a larger budget helps, you can also still find affordable shoes that offer very good value for your money. </p>
